# Documentation
it is use for pratice only

Documentation files are hosted under `/docs` folder.

Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org/) globally

```

```

# Running the website locally
You should run all these tasks from the inner `/website` folder.

The commands you need to use for serving the site locally:
- `cd website/` - Move to website folder, it contains docusaurus source code.
- `pnpm install` - Install all dependencies.
- `pnpm run start` - Runs Verdaccio documentation site on http://localhost:3000/
- `pnpm run build` - Build the website on build/ folder.

# Running the website as a Docker container

The Verdaccio documentation website can run as a Docker container
(useful for offline usage of the website).

 In order to run the website on Docker, use the following commands (run commands from the outer **/website** folder):

`docker build -t verdaccio-docs:4.0.1 . `- building the Verdaccio documentation site image
`docker run -p <host-port>:3000 verdaccio-docs:4.0.1 `- starting the container, listening on **<host-port>** for your choice.

Saving the image for later offline usage is available by building the container and then using `docker save verdaccio-docs:4.0.1 > <tar-name>.tar` and loading it afterwards with `docker load < <tar-name>.tar `.
> tested on ubuntu 18.04.2 with Docker 18.09.6
