## Installing the Yeoman Generator {#installing-the-yeoman-generator}

Verdaccio is a pluggable application whose objective is to help developers generate new plugins. To achieve this, we provide a custom generator based on **[Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)** that can be used to generate all kinds of plugins.

To install the generator, the first step is to install the _Yeoman_ command-line tool, `yo`.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Next, install the custom generator by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g generator-verdaccio-plugin
```
