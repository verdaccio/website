You can use a custom registry either setting globally for all your projects

    npm set registry http://localhost:4873
    

or by command line as argument `--registry` in npm (slightly different in yarn)

    npm install lodash --registry http://localhost:4873
    

## Private

All packages that you publish are private and only accessible based in your configuration.

## Proxy

Verdaccio cache all dependencies by demand and speed up installations in local or private networks.
