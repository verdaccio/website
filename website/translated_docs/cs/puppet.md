Install verdaccio for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and RedHat.

# Usage

There are two variants to install verdaccio using this Puppet module:

* Apply-mode (with puppet-apply and no puppetmaster setup needed)
* Master-Agent-mode (with puppet-agent accessing your configuration through the puppetmaster).

In both variants you have to explicitely call "class nodejs {}" in your puppet script because the puppet-verdaccio module only defines this as a requirement, so you have all the flexibility you want when installing nodejs. Scroll down for details about Master-Agent-mode variant.
