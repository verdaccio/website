To pull the latest pre-built [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/verdaccio/verdaccio/):

```bash
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio
```

## Tagged Versions

Since version `v2.x` you can pull docker images by [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/verdaccio/verdaccio/tags/), as follows:

For a major version:

```bash
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio:3
```

For a minor version:

```bash
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio:3.0
```

For a specific (patch) version:

```bash
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio:3.0.1
```

For the next major release using the `beta` (master branch) version.

```bash
docker pull verdaccio/verdaccio:beta
```

## Running verdaccio using Docker

To run the docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name verdaccio -p 4873:4873 verdaccio/verdaccio
```

The last argument defines which image to use. The above line will pull the latest prebuilt image from dockerhub, if you haven't done that already.

If you have [build an image locally](#build-your-own-docker-image) use `verdaccio` as the last argument.

You can use `-v` to bind mount `conf`, `storage` and `plugins` to the hosts filesystem:

```bash
V_PATH=/path/for/verdaccio; docker run -it --rm --name verdaccio -p 4873:4873 \
  -v $V_PATH/conf:/verdaccio/conf \
  -v $V_PATH/storage:/verdaccio/storage \
  -v $V_PATH/plugins:/verdaccio/plugins \
  verdaccio/verdaccio
```

> Note: Verdaccio runs as a non-root user (uid=100, gid=101) inside the container, if you use bind mount to override default, you need to make sure the mount directory is assigned to the right user. In above example, you need to run `sudo chown -R 100:101 /opt/verdaccio` otherwise you will get permission errors at runtime. [Use docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) is recommended over using bind mount.

### Plugins

Plugins can be installed in a separate directory and mounted using Docker or Kubernetes, however make sure you build plugins with native dependencies using the same base image as the Verdaccio Dockerfile.

### Docker and custom port configuration

Any `host:port` configured in `conf/config.yaml` under `listen` is currently ignored when using docker.

If you want to reach verdaccio docker instance under different port, lets say `5000` in your `docker run` command replace `-p 4873:4873` with `-p 5000:4873`.

In case you need to specify which port to listen to **in the docker container**, since version 2.?.? you can do so by providing additional arguments to `docker run`: `--env PORT=5000` This changes which port the docker container exposes and the port verdaccio listens to.

Of course the numbers you give to `-p` paremeter need to match, so assuming you want them to all be the same this is what you could copy, paste and adopt:

```bash
PORT=5000; docker run -it --rm --name verdaccio \
  --env PORT -p $PORT:$PORT
  verdaccio/verdaccio
```

### Using HTTPS with Docker

You can configure the protocol verdaccio is going to listen on, similarly to the port configuration. You have to overwrite the default value("http") of the `PROTOCOL` environment variable to "https", after you specified the certificates in the config.yaml.

```bash
PROTOCOL=https; docker run -it --rm --name verdaccio \
  --env PROTOCOL -p 4873:4873
  verdaccio/verdaccio
```

### Using docker-compose

1. Get the latest version of [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).
2. Build and run the container:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

You can set the port to use (for both container and host) by prefixing the above command with `PORT=5000`.

Docker will generate a named volume in which to store persistent application data. You can use `docker inspect` or `docker volume inspect` to reveal the physical location of the volume and edit the configuration, such as:

    $ docker volume inspect verdaccio_verdaccio
    [
        {
            "Name": "verdaccio_verdaccio",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/verdaccio_verdaccio/_data",
            "Labels": null,
            "Scope": "local"
        }
    ]
    
    

## Build your own Docker image

```bash
docker build -t verdaccio .
```

There is also an npm script for building the docker image, so you can also do:

```bash
npm run build:docker
```

Note: The first build takes some minutes to build because it needs to run `npm install`, and it will take that long again whenever you change any file that is not listed in `.dockerignore`.

If you want to use the docker image on a rpi or a compatible device there is also a dockerfile available. To build the docker image for raspberry pi execute:

```bash
npm run build:docker:rpi
```

Please note that for any of the above docker commands you need to have docker installed on your machine and the docker executable should be available on your `$PATH`.

## Docker Examples

There is a separate repository that hosts multiple configurations to compose Docker images with `verdaccio`, for instance, as reverse proxy:
