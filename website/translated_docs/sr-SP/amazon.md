This document describes several approaches for deploying Verdaccio in the AWS cloud.

## EC2

[CloudFormation template for deploying this stack.](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/blob/master/contrib/aws/cloudformation-ec2-efs.yaml)

<div id="codefund">''</div>

Architecture:

    Clients
     |
     | (HTTPS)
     v
    Application Load Balancer
     |
     | (HTTP)
     v
    EC2 Auto Scaling Group (Amazon Linux 2)
    Docker image (Verdaccio)
     |
     | (NFS)
     v
    Elastic File System
    

Architecture notes: * Deploy this stack into the region closest to your users for maximum performance. * We use an auto scaling group primarily for self-healing. The system requirements of Verdaccio are pretty low, so it's unlikely you'll need multiple instances to handle traffic load. * Because Amazon Linux 2 doesn't include Node, we run Verdaccio as a Docker image rather than natively on the instance. This is faster and more secure than relying on third party package sources for Node. * Elastic File System is cheap and stateful, and works across AZs. An alternative would be the [third-party S3 storage plugin](https://github.com/remitly/verdaccio-s3-storage). * For backup, use AWS Backup

Estimated monthly cost for a small installation (in us-east-1): * ALB (1 LCU average): $22.265/mo * EC2 (t3.nano): $3.796/mo * EBS (8gb): $0.80/mo * EFS (5gb): $1.5/mo * Data transfer: (10gb): $0.9/mo * **TOTAL:** Under $30/mo

## ECS

You can deploy Verdaccio as a task with an [ECS Volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_data_volumes.html) for persistent storage.

Note: Fargate doesn't support persistent volumes, so you have to use the S3 storage plugin.

## EKS

See the documentation pages on [Kubernetes](kubernetes) and [Docker](docker).
