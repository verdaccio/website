Notify was built primarily to use with Slack's Incoming
webhooks, but will also deliver a simple payload to
any endpoint. This is currently only active for the `npm publish`
command.

## Usage

An example with a **HipChat**, **Stride** and **Google Hangouts Chat** hook:

> Verdaccio supports any API, feel free to add more examples.

## Template

We use [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as main template engine.

### Format Examples

```
# iterate all versions
{{ name }}{{#each versions}} v{{version}}{{/each}}

# publisher and `dist-tag` package published
{{ publisher.name }} has published {{ publishedPackage }}
```

### Publisher

You can get access to the package publisher information in the `content` of a webhook using the `publisher` object.

See below the `publisher` object type:

```
{
  name: string,
  groups: string[],
  real_groups: string[]
}
```

An example:

```
notify:
  method: POST
  headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
  endpoint: https://usagge.hipchat.com/v2/room/3729485/notification?auth_token=mySecretToken
  content: '{"color":"green","message":"New package published: * {{ name }}*. Publisher name: * {{ publisher.name }} *.","notify":true,"message_format":"text"}'
```

**Note:** it's not possible to get the publisher information if the `package.json` file already has the `publisher` property.

### Package Published

You can access to the package is being published with the keyword `{{publishedPackage}}` as follows.

```
{{ publisher.name }} has published {{ publishedPackage }}
```
